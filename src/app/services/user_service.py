user_service.py

This module defines the UserService class, which acts as a business logic layer 
for managing user entities in a microservices-based FastAPI architecture.
It coordinates validation, transformation, and persistence of user data while
abstracting away repository and database details from API routes and controllers.

Overview:
---------
- Implements typical user use cases: creation, lookup by email, and profile updates.
- Follows the service-layer pattern, centralizing business rules and security concerns 
  (such as password hashing and unique constraint management).
- Designed for async workflows, supporting scalable microservice deployments and non-blocking API endpoints.

Key Features:
-------------
- **Repository Abstraction:** Interacts exclusively with an injected user repository (repo), enabling 
  swap-in/swap-out of different persistence backends or mock implementations for testing.
- **Domain Model-Driven:** Accepts and returns strongly-typed domain models and schemas (`User`, `UserCreate`, `UserUpdate`),
  ensuring data integrity and predictable behavior throughout the service layer.
- **Business Logic Aggregation:** Orchestrates key concerns such as password hashing, email updates,
  API key management, and persistence, keeping routes/controllers slim and focused.
- **Extensible and Testable:** Structured for easy enhancement (e.g., add multi-factor logic, event emission) 
  and for unit/integration testing by using repository interface injection.

Usage:
------
- Inject as a dependency into FastAPI routers/handlers for all user management, profile, or account endpoints.
- Serves as the core orchestrator between API validation layers and persistence providers in a microservices ecosystem.

Dependencies:
-------------
- Pydantic schemas: UserCreate, UserUpdate
- ORM model: User
- A repository/DAO class implementing user data access
- Optional project-specific security utilities for password hashing

Security Considerations:
------------------------
- All password updates are securely hashed before saving, helping protect usersâ€™ credentials at rest.
- Business logic for other sensitive fields (e.g., API keys) can be centralized and locked-down here.
